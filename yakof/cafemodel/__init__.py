"""
Cafe Model.
==========

This module models cafe operations with capacity constraints across multiple dimensions:
- Sit-in customers: Occupying seating capacity
- Takeaway customers: Using service capacity without seating
- Ensemble: Representing different scenarios (weather, time of day) affecting operations

The model evaluates sustainability of cafe operations by checking:
1. Seating sustainability: Whether available seating can support sit-in customer demand
2. Service sustainability: Whether staff capacity can handle combined sit-in and takeaway demand

The model accounts for context-dependent factors:
- Weather: Affects available seating (outdoor seating only usable in sunny weather)
- Time of day: Affects service capacity and efficiency (e.g., more staff during lunch rush)
