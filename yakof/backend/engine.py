"""
Code for creating a bckend engine
=================================

This module contains code to create a specific backend engine. At the moment,
we only support NumPy, so this module is empty. We will support creating a generic
engine when we will add support for TensorFlow.
"""

# TODO(bassosimone): implement this file once we also have a
# TensorFlow engine to allow for choosing the engine.
